# Instagram CMD Bot ü§ñ

This project is an **Instagram automation bot** that:
- Logs into Instagram (restores session if possible).
- Dynamically loads commands from the `cmd/` folder.
- Allows turning commands `on` / `off` via Instagram DMs (`/cmdname on` or `/cmdname off`).
- Exposes a **Flask API** showing bot status, loaded commands, and developer info.
- Supports optional **SOCKS5 proxy** connection (configurable directly in the code).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Dynamic CMD loading from `cmd/` folder.
- Proxy support (`socks5://host:port` or with user/pass).

üìù CMD Development

Place .py files in cmd/.

Each file must define a run(cl, cmd_flags, cmd_name) function.

Example cmd/echo.py:

def run(cl, cmd_flags, cmd_name):
    while cmd_flags[cmd_name]:
        print("Echo running...")
